# P_Init

A Visual Studio Code extension that automatically renders every `__init__.py` file in the Explorer using a dark grey tint (`#70707099`).

## Features

Control and manage `__init__.py` files in your Python projects directly from VS Code.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code v1.93.0 or higher
- Node.js for development

## Extension Settings
No user-facing settings are required—the extension contributes a color token named `pinit.decorations.initFile` (default `#70707099`) and uses it for every Explorer decoration.

You can open the `P_Init` output channel (View → Output → P_Init) to view simple activation logs.

## Known Issues

None at this time.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
